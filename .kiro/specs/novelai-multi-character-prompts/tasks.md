# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Implement backend character prompt processing






  - Define Python data classes for character prompt handling
  - Modify `generate_novelai_image()` function to accept and process character prompt data
  - Update NovelAI API request builder to populate char_captions arrays with character data
  - Extend `make_prompt_dynamic()` function to process character prompts independently
  - Implement logic to omit empty character prompts from API requests
  - Add error handling for character-specific API errors and validation
  - Write unit tests for character prompt processing and dynamic prompt integration
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 6.1, 6.2, 6.4_

- [x] 2. Update image metadata handling for character prompts





  - Modify image metadata storage to include character prompt information
  - Implement logic to omit empty negative prompts from metadata
  - Ensure character metadata is preserved in generated images
  - Update metadata display logic to show character prompt information
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 3. Create frontend character prompt management interface





  - Add HTML structure for character prompt sections in index.html template
  - Implement TypeScript functions for adding and removing character prompt sections
  - Create character prompt input fields with proper labeling and validation
  - Create toggle controls for positive and negative prompt visibility
  - Implement TypeScript functions to show/hide prompt sections while preserving values
  - Add visual indicators for hidden sections that contain content

  - Include CSS styling for character prompt sections and responsive design
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Update form data processing for character prompts
  - Modify form serialization to include character prompt data in proper format
  - Update backend form processing to handle character prompt arrays
  - Ensure character prompt data is correctly parsed and validated
  - Add form validation for character prompt length and structure
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 6.1_

- [x] 5. Enhance copy prompt functionality for character data
  - Update `updateGridModalImage()` function to handle character prompt metadata
  - Modify copy prompt button logic to populate character prompt interface sections
  - Ensure character prompt data is correctly transferred to the prompt interface
  - Maintain existing copy functionality for non-character prompts
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 6. Update provider switching logic for character prompts
  - Modify `providerChanged()` function to show/hide character prompt interface
  - Ensure character prompt sections only appear when NovelAI is selected
  - Preserve character prompt data when switching between providers
  - Handle cleanup of character prompt interface when switching away from NovelAI
  - Add comprehensive error handling and validation for character prompt functionality
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.4, 6.4_
