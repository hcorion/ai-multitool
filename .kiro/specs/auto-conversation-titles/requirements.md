# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will automatically generate conversation titles on the server side using the initial user question, eliminating the need for manual user input. The system will use a cost-effective AI model (o3-mini) to create concise, descriptive titles based on the conversation's first message.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want conversation titles to be generated automatically based on my initial question, so that I don't have to manually enter a title every time I start a new chat.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends their first message in a new conversation THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a title using the message content
2. WHEN generating a title THEN the system SHALL use the o3-mini model with minimal reasoning to keep costs low
3. WHEN generating a title THEN the system SHALL limit the title to a maximum of 30 characters
4. WHEN the title generation fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to a default title format like "Chat - [timestamp]"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the automatically generated titles to be descriptive and relevant to my question, so that I can easily identify conversations in my chat history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a title THEN the system SHALL create a concise summary of the user's initial question or topic
2. WHEN the user's message is too short or generic THEN the system SHALL still generate a meaningful title
3. WHEN the user's message contains sensitive information THEN the system SHALL create a generic but relevant title without exposing sensitive details
4. WHEN multiple conversations have similar topics THEN the system SHALL generate distinguishable titles

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the title generation to be integrated seamlessly into the existing chat flow, so that the user experience remains smooth and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing title generation THEN the system SHALL not significantly impact chat response time
2. WHEN title generation is in progress THEN the conversation SHALL still be created and functional
3. WHEN the title is generated THEN the frontend SHALL update to display the new title without requiring a page refresh
4. WHEN title generation fails THEN the conversation SHALL continue to work normally with a fallback title
