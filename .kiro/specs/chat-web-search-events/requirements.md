# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds support for web search events from OpenAI's Responses API to the AI Multitool chat system and enhances status updates for reasoning processes. When the AI performs web searches or reasoning during response generation, users will be able to see real-time status updates and view the search results alongside the reasoning information. This enhances transparency by showing users what external information is being accessed and when the AI is actively reasoning to generate responses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user engaging in chat conversations, I want to see when the AI is performing web searches, so that I understand what external information is being used to generate responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI starts a web search THEN the system SHALL display a status indicator showing "Searching..." with a brief description of what is being searched
2. WHEN a web search is in progress THEN the system SHALL update the status to show the search is actively running
3. WHEN a web search completes THEN the system SHALL update the status to indicate completion and briefly show what was found
4. WHEN multiple web searches occur THEN the system SHALL handle and display each search operation appropriately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to capture and store web search data during chat generation, so that I can review what information the AI accessed when formulating its response.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing response streams THEN the system SHALL capture web search events including response.web_search_call.in_progress, response.web_search_call.searching, and response.web_search_call.completed
2. WHEN web search data is received THEN the system SHALL extract relevant information such as search queries, results, and timestamps
3. WHEN storing conversation data THEN the system SHALL include web search information alongside existing reasoning data
4. WHEN web search events occur THEN the system SHALL associate them with the corresponding chat message for later retrieval

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view web search details in the reasoning inspection modal, so that I can understand what external sources informed the AI's response.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the reasoning modal is displayed AND web search data exists THEN the system SHALL show web search information in a dedicated tab or section
2. WHEN displaying web search data THEN the system SHALL show search queries, result summaries, and timestamps in a readable format
3. WHEN multiple searches were performed THEN the system SHALL organize and display them chronologically or by relevance
4. WHEN web search data is extensive THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate formatting and scrolling to make it accessible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want web search status updates to appear seamlessly in the chat interface, so that I stay informed without disrupting my conversation flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN web search events occur THEN the system SHALL display status updates in the current message area without creating separate messages
2. WHEN a web search is in progress THEN the system SHALL show a subtle loading indicator or status text
3. WHEN web searches complete THEN the system SHALL briefly show completion status before continuing with the response
4. WHEN the final response is complete THEN the system SHALL remove temporary search status indicators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see when the AI is actively reasoning, so that I understand the AI is processing my request and working on a response.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reasoning events begin THEN the system SHALL display a status indicator showing "Thinking..." or similar
2. WHEN reasoning is in progress THEN the system SHALL maintain the status indicator to show ongoing processing
3. WHEN reasoning completes THEN the system SHALL update the status to indicate the reasoning phase is finished
4. WHEN both reasoning and web search occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate status for each process

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want web search and reasoning event handling to integrate cleanly with existing stream processing, so that it doesn't interfere with current chat functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN web search or reasoning events are received THEN the system SHALL process them using the existing stream event handling architecture
2. WHEN web search or reasoning processing fails THEN the system SHALL continue normal chat functionality without interruption
3. WHEN storing web search data THEN the system SHALL use a consistent data format that integrates with existing conversation storage
4. WHEN web search or reasoning events are not present THEN the system SHALL operate normally without any degradation
