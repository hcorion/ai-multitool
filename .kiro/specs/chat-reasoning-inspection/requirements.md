# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds the ability to generate, store, and inspect reasoning output for chat messages in the AI Multitool application. Users will be able to view detailed reasoning summaries that show how the AI arrived at its responses, providing transparency and insight into the AI's thought process. The feature integrates with OpenAI's Responses API reasoning capabilities and provides a user-friendly interface for accessing this information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user engaging in chat conversations, I want to see an inspection button on AI messages, so that I can access detailed reasoning information when I'm curious about how the AI arrived at its response.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chat message is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a small "i" (info) button in the corner of each AI message
2. WHEN the user hovers over the "i" button THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating it's clickable
3. WHEN the user clicks the "i" button THEN the system SHALL display a popup/modal containing the reasoning details
4. IF no reasoning data is available for a message THEN the system SHALL either hide the "i" button or show an appropriate message in the popup

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically capture reasoning output during chat generation, so that the reasoning information is available for inspection without requiring additional API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making a chat request to OpenAI's Responses API THEN the system SHALL include "summary": "detailed" in the reasoning section of the request
2. WHEN processing the response stream THEN the system SHALL capture and store reasoning events including response.reasoning_summary_part.added, response.reasoning_summary_text.delta, response.reasoning_summary_text.done, and response.reasoning_summary_part.done
3. WHEN reasoning data is received THEN the system SHALL associate it with the corresponding chat message for later retrieval
4. WHEN storing conversation data THEN the system SHALL include reasoning information in the conversation storage format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view comprehensive reasoning details in an easy-to-read format, so that I can understand the AI's thought process and decision-making steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the reasoning popup is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the complete reasoning summary text in a readable format
2. WHEN reasoning contains multiple parts or sections THEN the system SHALL organize and display them clearly
3. WHEN the reasoning text is long THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate scrolling or formatting to make it accessible
4. WHEN the user wants to close the reasoning popup THEN the system SHALL provide clear close functionality (X button, click outside, or ESC key)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the reasoning inspection feature to work seamlessly with existing chat functionality, so that it doesn't interfere with my normal chat experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the reasoning feature is active THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing chat functionality without degradation
2. WHEN reasoning data is being processed THEN the system SHALL not block or delay the display of the actual chat message
3. WHEN reasoning inspection is not being used THEN the system SHALL have minimal performance impact on chat operations
4. WHEN conversations are shared or exported THEN the system SHALL handle reasoning data appropriately (include or exclude based on context)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the reasoning data to be properly structured and stored, so that it can be reliably retrieved and displayed when requested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reasoning events are received from the API THEN the system SHALL parse and structure the data correctly
2. WHEN storing reasoning data THEN the system SHALL use a consistent data format that can be easily retrieved
3. WHEN retrieving reasoning data THEN the system SHALL handle cases where data might be missing or corrupted gracefully
4. WHEN reasoning data exceeds reasonable size limits THEN the system SHALL handle it appropriately (truncation, pagination, or warning)
