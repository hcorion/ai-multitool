# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on performing a comprehensive cleanup of the AI Multitool codebase to improve maintainability, reduce technical debt, and eliminate obsolete code. The cleanup will address test redundancy, legacy code removal, dead code elimination, and general code organization improvements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want inpainting-related source files organized in a subfolder, so that core files remain isolated and the project structure is cleaner.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the src directory THEN the system SHALL identify inpainting-related TypeScript files
2. WHEN creating the subfolder THEN the system SHALL move inpainting files to src/inpainting/
3. WHEN moving inpainting files THEN the system SHALL update all import statements accordingly
4. WHEN moving inpainting files THEN the system SHALL preserve core files (script.ts, utils.ts, chat.ts) in src root
5. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL ensure all functionality continues to work correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want outdated and redundant tests removed, so that the test suite is focused and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the test suite THEN the system SHALL identify tests for non-existent endpoints
2. WHEN analyzing the test suite THEN the system SHALL identify tests for deprecated functionality
3. WHEN analyzing the test suite THEN the system SHALL identify duplicate or redundant test coverage
4. WHEN removing obsolete tests THEN the system SHALL preserve essential test coverage for active features
5. WHEN consolidating tests THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive coverage with fewer, more focused tests

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want legacy frontend code that has been replaced removed, so that the codebase doesn't contain duplicate implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing frontend code THEN the system SHALL identify legacy callback-based code that has been replaced by async equivalents
2. WHEN analyzing frontend code THEN the system SHALL identify old webworker implementations that have been superseded
3. WHEN analyzing frontend code THEN the system SHALL identify grid functionality that needs backend integration with the unified API
4. WHEN removing legacy code THEN the system SHALL ensure no active functionality depends on the old implementations
5. WHEN connecting grid functionality THEN the system SHALL integrate it with the unified image API and remove old endpoints

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want dead code paths eliminated and duplicate code consolidated, so that the codebase is lean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify unused functions and classes
2. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify unreachable code paths and outdated testing infrastructure code
3. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify duplicate function implementations and similar code patterns
4. WHEN removing dead code THEN the system SHALL verify no active functionality depends on it
5. WHEN consolidating duplicate code THEN the system SHALL create reusable utility functions and update all references

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want commented code and debugging output removed, so that the codebase is clean and production-ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify commented-out code blocks
2. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify unnecessary print statements and console.log calls
3. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify debugging-specific code that serves no production purpose
4. WHEN removing debugging code THEN the system SHALL preserve legitimate error handling and logging
5. WHEN removing debugging code THEN the system SHALL maintain performance monitoring that serves operational purposes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want functions documented with brief, succinct comments, so that code purpose is clear without being verbose.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing functions THEN the system SHALL identify those lacking documentation
2. WHEN adding documentation THEN the system SHALL write brief, clear docstrings
3. WHEN adding documentation THEN the system SHALL focus on function purpose and key parameters
4. WHEN adding documentation THEN the system SHALL avoid verbose or redundant comments
5. WHEN adding documentation THEN the system SHALL follow Python and TypeScript documentation conventions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase organized with consistent patterns, so that navigation and maintenance are improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing code organization THEN the system SHALL identify inconsistent naming patterns
2. WHEN analyzing code organization THEN the system SHALL identify misplaced utility functions
3. WHEN reorganizing code THEN the system SHALL group related functionality together
4. WHEN reorganizing code THEN the system SHALL maintain existing import paths where possible
5. WHEN reorganizing code THEN the system SHALL update all references to moved code
