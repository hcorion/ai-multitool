# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds agent preset functionality and reasoning level controls to the AI Multitool chat interface. Users will be able to create and manage multiple agent configurations with different instruction presets and default reasoning levels, while also having the ability to override reasoning levels on a per-message basis during conversations.

## Glossary

- **Agent_Preset**: A saved configuration containing system instructions and default reasoning level settings
- **Reasoning_Level**: The cognitive processing intensity (high, medium, low) used by the AI model
- **Chat_Interface**: The conversational UI component of the AI Multitool
- **System_Instructions**: The behavioral guidelines and context provided to the AI agent
- **Default_Agent**: The built-in agent preset used when no custom preset is selected
- **Message_Override**: The ability to specify a different reasoning level for a single chat message

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage multiple agent presets with different instruction sets, so that I can quickly switch between different AI personalities or specialized assistants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Chat_Interface SHALL provide a mechanism to create new Agent_Preset configurations
2. WHEN creating an Agent_Preset, THE Chat_Interface SHALL allow users to specify custom System_Instructions
3. WHEN creating an Agent_Preset, THE Chat_Interface SHALL allow users to set a default Reasoning_Level (high, medium, or low)
4. THE Chat_Interface SHALL provide functionality to edit existing Agent_Preset configurations
5. THE Chat_Interface SHALL provide functionality to delete Agent_Preset configurations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select different agent presets before starting a conversation, so that I can tailor the AI's behavior to my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Chat_Interface SHALL display a list of available Agent_Preset options
2. WHEN starting a new conversation, THE Chat_Interface SHALL allow users to select an Agent_Preset
3. THE Chat_Interface SHALL use the Default_Agent when no specific Agent_Preset is selected
4. WHEN an Agent_Preset is selected, THE Chat_Interface SHALL apply the associated System_Instructions to the conversation
5. WHEN an Agent_Preset is selected, THE Chat_Interface SHALL use the preset's default Reasoning_Level for messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to override the reasoning level for individual messages within a conversation, so that I can request more or less detailed responses as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Chat_Interface SHALL provide controls to specify Reasoning_Level for individual messages
2. WHEN a Message_Override is specified, THE Chat_Interface SHALL use the override Reasoning_Level instead of the default
3. THE Chat_Interface SHALL support high, medium, and low Reasoning_Level options for Message_Override
4. WHEN no Message_Override is specified, THE Chat_Interface SHALL use the Agent_Preset's default Reasoning_Level
5. THE Chat_Interface SHALL visually indicate when a Message_Override is active

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my agent presets to be saved and persist across sessions, so that I don't have to recreate them each time I use the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Chat_Interface SHALL save Agent_Preset configurations to persistent storage
2. WHEN the application loads, THE Chat_Interface SHALL restore previously saved Agent_Preset configurations
3. THE Chat_Interface SHALL maintain Agent_Preset data across browser sessions
4. THE Chat_Interface SHALL provide a default Agent_Preset that cannot be deleted
5. THE Chat_Interface SHALL handle Agent_Preset data corruption gracefully with fallback to defaults

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see which agent preset and reasoning level are being used in my conversations, so that I can understand the context of the AI's responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Chat_Interface SHALL display the active Agent_Preset name in the conversation interface
2. THE Chat_Interface SHALL indicate the current Reasoning_Level being used for each message
3. WHEN a Message_Override is used, THE Chat_Interface SHALL visually distinguish it from default settings
4. THE Chat_Interface SHALL provide tooltips or help text explaining Reasoning_Level differences
5. THE Chat_Interface SHALL maintain visual consistency with the existing chat interface design
